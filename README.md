# How to run this program

After cloning the repository and opening it up in the local code editor, open two terminals. Change directory (cd) into the frontend for the first terminal you open and cd into the backend of the second terminal. After completing that step, npm install in both the frontend folder (first teriminal) and backend folder (second terminal) you opened to download/install dependencies. 

Navigate to the servers.js file in the backend folder and update the URI for MongoDB in line 28. Make sure to add your IP address to the MongoDB server. Then, run npm start in the backend folder terminal. You should see a server started on port 8000 and that it connected to MongoDB. 

Then, in the frontend terminal, also execute npm start. The web app should pop up in your browser and you should be able to access it.

# Shell Script
it starts the backend and frontend with simple shell commands but make sure to check that both are running correctly.
you do need to make sure to change the permissions of the shell script to execute


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
